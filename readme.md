WMI: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa393964(v=vs.85)<br />
Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) is the infrastructure for management <br />
data and operations on Windows-based operating systems. You can write WMI <br />
scripts or applications to automate administrative tasks on remote computers <br />
but WMI also supplies management data to other parts of the operating system <br />
and products, for example System Center Operations Manager, formerly Microsoft <br />
Operations Manager (MOM), or Windows Remote Management <br />
<br />
Open Hardware Monitor: http://openhardwaremonitor.org/<br />
The Open Hardware Monitor is a free open source software that monitors <br />
temperature sensors, fan speeds, voltages, load and clock speeds of a computer.<br />
